# Serenity/JS

Serenity/JS is a node.js library designed to make acceptance and regression testing of modern web applications
faster, more collaborative and easier to scale.

Serenity/JS gives you:
* the scalability and expressiveness of the [Screenplay Pattern](docs/screenplay-pattern.md),
* the power and visibility of [Serenity BDD](http://serenity-bdd.info/#/documentation)
[narrative reports](http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/#_detailed_description_of_aggregation_reports),
* an easy way to introduce and follow [SOLID design principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)),
* easy integration with popular test automation tools,
such as [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor),
[Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) (with more to come!)

Although Serenity/JS provides strong support for automating web tests using Protractor and Webdriver,
it works very effectively for non-web tests too! Those include tests that exercise web services or even call application code directly.

| --------- | ----------- |
| :warning: | Serenity/JS is an experimental project. This means that although it has a **very high test coverage**, follows **semantic versioning** and **you can use it straight away**, its structure and APIs might and most likely will change over the coming weeks. Is that a problem? We hope not! The feedback from the Community will help us shape Serenity/JS to your needs. Together we can build the best acceptance testing library the JavaScript world has ever seen! ... or at least something useful :wink: |
