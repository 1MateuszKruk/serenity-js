# Serenity.js

Serenity JS is an open source library that aims to make the idea
of [living documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) a reality.

Based on the popular [Serenity BDD for the JVM](http://serenity-bdd.info/),
Serenity JS helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster.
It helps you apply best [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
engineering practices and scale your automated tests easily
thanks to the [Screenplay Pattern](https://dzone.com/articles/page-objects-refactored-solid-steps-to-the-screenp).

Serenity uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works.
Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.

One key advantage of using Serenity JS is that you do not have to invest time in building and maintaining your own automation framework,
but you also don't have to drop the tools that you've used before either.
Serenity JS works well with [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) and [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js).

Although Serenity JS provides strong support for automating web tests using Selenium 2, it's also works very effectively
for non-web tests such as those that exercise web services or even call application code directly.
