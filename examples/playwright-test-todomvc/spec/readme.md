In order to quickly learn how to use Serenity/JS with Playwright Test
As a busy developer
I'd like to see an example

This `readme.md` file is called _"the narrative"_. It's a great place to describe the business
capabilities of your system and the features that help to enable them.

**Please note:** [Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org) lets your group Playwright Test `.spec` files in directories corresponding to "epics", "themes" or "business capabilities" of your system and provide
each one of those with additional context using a `readme.md` file.

**By the way:** Did you notice that you can use **[markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/)** to better express
your thoughts?
