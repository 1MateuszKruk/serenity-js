# The Screenplay Pattern

It has all started at the Agile Alliance Functional Testing Tools workshop (AAFTT) back in 2007.

["In praise of abstraction"](http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200710/20071013-In%20Praise%20of%20Abstraction.html),
a talk given by Kevin Lawrence, has inspired [Antony Marcano](http://antonymarcano.com/Site/Home.html)
to implement a fluent DSL based on Kevin's idea to use the language of Interaction Designers
to model the layers of abstraction in an acceptance test.
With help of [Andy Palmer](http://andypalmer.com), this fluent DSL is what became
[JNarrate](https://bitbucket.org/testingreflections/jnarrate/wiki/Home) a year later (2008).

In the late 2012, Antony and Andy joined their forces with [Jan Molak](https://janmolak.com/).
Their experiments with Kevin's model, combined with a desire to address problems with shortcomings of
the [PageObject Pattern](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects)
and apply [SOLID design principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
to acceptance testing is what [became known in 2013](http://www.slideshare.net/RiverGlide/a-journey-beyond-the-page-object-pattern)
as [screenplay-jvm](https://github.com/screenplay/screenplay-jvm).

In 2015, when Antony, Andy and Jan started working with [John Ferguson Smart](http://johnfergusonsmart.com/),
the Screenplay Pattern was finally born and found its way into [Serenity BDD](http://serenity-bdd.info),
a popular acceptance testing library written in Java.

It's 2016 now and you can use both the Screenplay Pattern and the powerful Serenity BDD reports on JavaScript
projects thanks to Serenity/JS.
