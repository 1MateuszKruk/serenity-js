# From Scripts to Serenity

In this series of 3 tutorials you'll learn how to write automated tests
and generate comprehensive test execution reports 
in the context of an [Angular](https://angular.io/) application, exercised using 
[Serenity/JS](https://github.com/jan-molak/serenity-js), 
[Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), 
[Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor), 
[Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/)
and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
 
You'll learn how to set up and write test scenarios using Serenity/JS and also:
- why [speaking the right language](speaking-the-right-language.md) is important and why Page Objects 
  are not the answer to the test script spaghetti,
- how [writing what you'd like to read](writing-what-you-would-like-to-read.md) can make
  an automated test easier to maintain,
- what to do to [make the tests speak for themselves](making-the-tests-speak-for-themselves.md)
  and communicate the state of your application better to both technical and non-technical members of your team.
