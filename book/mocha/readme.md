# Mocha 

[Mocha](mochajs.org) is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js.

Mocha's lightweight syntax and excellent support for executing asynchronous test scenarios,
combined with the power of Serenity/JS, make it a good choice for writing functional acceptance tests
that drive the development of new systems or provide a safety net around the legacy ones.
