# Serenity/JS Release Notes

In this part of the handbook you'll learn:
- how the [Serenity/JS versioning system](/handbook/release-notes/versioning.html) works and what we do to keep your tests safe from our backwards-incompatible changes,
- what's new in [Serenity/JS 2.x](/handbook/release-notes/serenity-js-2.html), and how to upgrade your existing Serenity/JS 1.x project,
- what's new in [Serenity/JS 3.x](/handbook/release-notes/serenity-js-3.html), and how to upgrade your existing Serenity/JS 2.x project.

You might also want to have a look at the [detailed changelog](/changelog.html).
