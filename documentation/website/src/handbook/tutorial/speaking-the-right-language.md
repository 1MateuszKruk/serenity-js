# Speaking the right language

As the applications we develop become even more sophisticated and business-critical,
the priorities for test automation systems change as well.
The responsibility of automated tests is no longer limited to simple functional verification of the system, but rather,
they are often expected to capture the business language and intent behind its various features and act as living documentation.

The advent of [shift-left testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing)
has changed not only the role of the tester, but
the responsibility for writing and maintaining the tests changed too. Automated acceptance tests need to be accessible
that's why the quality of their implementation can't be overlooked anymore.

Internal, external audit, developers, testers, business, UX
