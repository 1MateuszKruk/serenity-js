# From Scripts to Serenity

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to write automated acceptance tests interacting with an Angular web app.

You'll learn how to use the Serenity/JS framework and integrate it with Cucumber.js and Protractor, and also
how to use Serenity/JS to generate comprehensive test execution reports.

This tutorial consists of three articles, where you'll learn:
- why speaking the right language is important and why Page Objects are not the answer to a test script spaghetti,
- how writing what you'd like to read can make an automated test easier to maintain,
- and what to do to make the tests speak for themselves and communicate the state of your application better to both technical and non-technical members of your team.

Ready? Let's get started!
