## Mentoring

If you'd like to fast-track your test automation efforts and get the befits a reliable, high-quality, easy to maintain automated test suite sooner,
consider opting for individual or team mentoring with the Serenity/JS core team.

The mentoring packages you can purchase via Github Sponsors or [directly](mailto:jan.molak@serenity.io?subject=Serenity/JS Mentoring) will help you answer questions such as:
- How do we get our traditional (possibly manual) testers up to speed with modern test automation practices and Serenity/JS?
- How do we adapt the tests to work in our environment and with our infrastructure?
- How can we make our tests more robust and easier to maintain?

The Serenity/JS mentoring packages provide a cost-effective answer to these problems.

Training is delivered by core contributors, including the author of the framework.
